 in New York City

Introduction 
 
 
This report presents statistics on race/ethnicity compiled from the New York City 
Police Department’s records management system.  Crime Complaint Reports contain 
information on the crime victims’ race and ethnicity as recorded by the officers or 
precinct clerical staff interviewing the victim or complainant.  The victim’s description of 
any non-arrested suspects will also be recorded on the crime complaint report.  Arrests 
made by the responding officers will be recorded on an arrest report associated with the 
crime complaint report and used to initiate the booking system.  Once the information has 
been entered and “signed” off by a supervisor it is stored in the Department’s Enterprise 
Data Warehouse.  The data for this report were drawn from the Data Warehouse.    
Additional information was drawn from a separate Homicide and Shooting Database that 
collects additional statistical information for Murder and Shooting incidents. 
 
 
The crime complaint and arrest data contained in this report represent crimes 
occurring from January 1, 2023 thru December 31, 2023 for the general crime complaint 
and arrest data (compiled on January 15, 2024).  The Murder and Shooting tables and 
charts are also based on incidents that occurred through December 31, 2023 as are the 
statistics presented for Firearm arrests (compiled on January 15, 2024). 
 
 
 
Stop Question and Frisk data and Violent Crime Suspect information are taken 
from the New York City Police Department’s Stop, Question and Frisk Database which is 
also the source of the quarterly report on Stop Question and Frisk Activity supplied to the 
New York City Council for all 4 quarters 2023. 
 
 
 
Statistical Considerations 
 
 
Commercial victimizations are generally noted on crime complaint reports and are 
excluded from the statistics dealing with specific categories of crime.  However, it is 
likely that a small number of commercial victimizations may be inadvertently included in 
the victim data when a report is not properly classified as a commercial victimization. 
Those cases would generally present the race/ethnicity of employees as the crime victims.   
 
 
Both crime complaint reports and arrest reports are classified according to the 
most serious crime recorded or charge lodged.  Arrest statistics represent arrests made by  
all Police agencies operating within the confines of New York City and arresting and 
charging individuals with crime under New York State laws.  The arrest statistics 
presented here do not include arrests made by federal agencies. 
 
 
 
Crime complaint statistics used in these tables and charts are from crimes 
occurring during calendar year 2023 and Arrest statistics presented represent arrests made 
during calendar year 2023.  Crime complaint reports that were recorded during calendar 
year 2023 but report an incident occurring in prior years are excluded from these 
 
ii 
statistics.  Arrest reports included in these statistics do include arrests made during 
calendar year 2023 for incidents that may have occurred in prior years. 
 
 
Black Hispanic and White Hispanic categories have been combined into a single 
Hispanic category for the statistical tables and charts presented in this report.  The 
categories of Black and White used in tables and charts through out this report therefore 
represent Black Non-Hispanic and White Non-Hispanic.  The labels Black and White are 
used for the sake of brevity and simplicity of presentation in the various tables and charts. 
 
 
The New York City Police Department’s Crime Reporting System uses a two 
tiered crime classification system.   The broadest level of categorization is used to present 
the statistics in this report.  Specific broad Crime categories however may contain only 
some subcategories for which suspect descriptions are typically available (e.g. a Larceny 
from the person will normally provide some suspect descriptive information while a 
larceny from a business office without a witness will not).  For certain broad crime 
categories the number of crime complaints that contain suspect descriptions with race/ 
ethnicity information will therefore only be a portion of the total complaints recorded.   
 
 
The tables included in the report contain overall statistics that explain the 
available victim and suspect information for each broad crime category.  The victim 
count for the period for the example table below, Misdemeanor Criminal Mischief is 
27,157.  Of these victims, 18,060 had information on the race/ethnicity of a non-
commercial victim.  Within this crime complaint population suspect information was 
available for 20,509 suspects and the race/ethnicity of 9,655 of those suspects was 
available.  During calendar year 2023 4,942 misdemeanor criminal mischief arrests were 
made and 4,882 of these records contained race/ethnicity information.

report.

An initial crime complaint report may record a crime with several suspects some 
of whom may be arrested at the time the crime is reported and recorded.  The non- 
arrested suspects are included in the “suspect” statistics in the tables and charts included  
in this report and arrested individuals are included in the “arrestee” statistics.  At the time 
these statistics were compiled additional follow up arrests may have been made 
increasing the number of arrested suspects.  In so far as that situation has occurred within 
calendar year 2023 data presented the suspect and arrests data will overlap and count the 
same individual as both suspect and arrestee if a follow up arrest has been made during 
the period.   
 
 
Arrest statistics are drawn from the initial booking data collected by the arresting 
officer prior to arraignment.  The small number of arrest records without race/ethnicity 
may result from arrestees that have no identification and whose race/ethnicity cannot 
initially be determined before arraignment or due to administrative omissions in report 
preparation. 
 
 
The race/ethnicity of victims are recorded by the officer or precinct clerical staff 
who 
are 
taking 
the 
report 
and 
rely 
on 
that 
interaction 
with 
the 
victim/complainant/reporter to determine the victims race/ethnicity.  The suspect’s 
description is also recorded at this time but relies on the victim’s assessment of race and 
ethnicity given their interaction with the suspect.  The arrestee race/ethnicity is recorded 
as a result of the officers assessment of the individual’s identification documents the 
individual’s physical characteristics and in many cases their prior criminal record.  
Arrestee race/ethnicity and victim designation of suspect race/ethnicity may therefore 
vary due to the different methods of determination.    
 
 
 
Classification as a Shooting incident is based upon a bullet striking the victim.  A 
Shooting incident therefore contains complaints for violent crimes such as Rape, Robbery 
and Felonious Assault as well as Murders committed with a firearm.  This category there- 
for is not mutually exclusive with the broad crime classifications used in the other tables 
and charts within this report but is meant to isolate those specific instances where 
firearms are used to cause harm regardless of the other crimes committed. 
 
 
Some crime categories are principally proactive enforcement events and will have 
no specific victim e.g. drug possession, sale and manufacture.  The race/ethnicity of 
arrested individuals is reported for these categories.  Additionally possible drug related 
criminal activity is also reported as allegations via 911 and various hot lines.  Criminal 
activity noted in allegations requires further investigation to determine if criminal activity 
is actually occurring as suspected in the report from the public.  Arrests may result from 
those follow-up investigations.  Drug allegations may contain suspect race/ethnicity 
descriptions. 
 
The Arrest statistics dealing with firearm arrests are a special compilation 
focusing on arrests that remove one or more firearms from the street.  The arrests so 
identified are arrests that include selected Felony Dangerous Weapons charges, indicate 
 
iv 
by specific report entries the presence of a firearm and finally that a firearm was 
vouchered as a result of the arrest.  A firearm arrest will be counted if these conditions 
are met by an arrest containing other charges, some of which may be for serious violent 
felonies. The Firearm Arrest statistics therefore include arrests for other violent crimes 
that are also included in other tables within this report.

Firearm Arrests (satisfying specific selection criteria)

frequently Black (68.4%) or Hispanic (25.6%). 
White arrestees account for (3.8%) and Asian
